# COGS108_Project
Group project for the course COGS108



This is my group project for the course COGS108 during the Spring 2024 Quarter. Our project involved analyzing data to compare hospital ratings from different sources. Each group member contributed to the research, extraction, analysis, and cleaning of datasets from these sources. Navigate to "Final_Project.ipynb" to find the final product of the project.
